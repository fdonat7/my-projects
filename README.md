# my-projects
Hi! I'm Francesco, nice to meet you :)

In this repository you can find some of the projects and labs I've done together with my team mates throughout my academic journey.

Each folder contains both codes and reports.


PROJECTS DESCRIPTION:

- **Applied Machine Learning for Health**->
  Implemented five machine learning frameworks applied to healthcare in Python: linear and gaussian processes regression, clustering, decision trees, hidden Markov models, independent 
  component analysis.

- **Statistical Learning and Neural Networks**->
  Developed different machine learning and deep learning methodologies in MatLab.

- **Smart Study Room**->
  Devised and implemented decentralized and modular IoT devices ecosystem for the management and control of a smart study room.
      
  Exploited sensors to control room's brightness, noise, temperature, student access via authentication, CO2 and humidity levels. Built on Raspberry Pi and Arduino IDE.

  Programmed with MQTT and REST communication paradigms. Used cherrypy Python library.

  Created user interface for critical values detection  via Telegram and statistical data visualization via ThingSpeak. Cooperated in a team of 4 students.

  Deployed Docker micro-services to improve application flexibility and interoperability.

  A video demo is available at this link: https://youtu.be/IbUyeea4UAU.

- **U.S. Dollar to Euro Spot Exchange Rate: Modeling and Prediction**->
  Developed jointly optimized ARMA model for the prediction of the U.S. dollar to euro spot exchange rate.

- **Drone assisted communication system simulation**->
  Modeled a MU-MIMO queuing system network based on ground base stations and UAVs. Programmed and simulated the system in Python under variable configurations.


Thank you for your interest!
