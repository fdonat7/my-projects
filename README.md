# my-projects
Hi! I'm Francesco, nice to meet you :)

In this repository you can find some of the projects and labs I've done together with my team mates throughout my academic journey.

Each folder contains both codes and reports.

Regarding the Smart Study Room project, a video demo is available at this link: https://youtu.be/IbUyeea4UAU.

Thank you for your interest!
